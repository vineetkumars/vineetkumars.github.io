<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<body>
<nav>
I am a faculty member at Yale School of Management, with expertise in Digital Technologies.

My  interests are in studying technology markets, especially for digital products and services.
Products based on Digital Technologies are becoming ubiquitous in a wide range of industries, ranging from financial services to healthcare to media.
I aim to develop a careful understanding of how firms can design, develop and take to market products that have potential for transforming peopleâ€™s lives.
Competency in an understanding of technology is important, of course, but more crucially, complementing this knowledge with a deep understanding of customer value and designing strategies based on such research has potential to create enhanced value for both firms and consumers.
Technology and Digital Markets present a set of important and new issues. My research in this area spans the following aspects:
<ol type="A">
<li> Consumer Choices in Technology Markets
<li> Direct and Indirect Network effects
<li> Big Data (especially high frequency microdata and unstructured data)
<li> Technology Transformation
</ol>
<p>
Methodologically, I develop models from microfoundations of consumer and firm behavior that are informed by theory and institutional knowledge.
Here's more information on my research and teaching.
