Hi Shuba,
It was great to meet you yesterday at BU. Thank you for the kind and supportive words about my current situation, it was really helpful to hear that, and to take a bigger picture perspective. I really enjoyed our one-on-one conversation, and the idea exchanges during the seminar. Look forward to connecting again once my search is complete, and my crazy schedule becomes a bit more normal.

Best,
Vineet

Hi Monic,
It was great to meet you during my visit to BU, thank you all for having me over. I really enjoyed our conversation about keeping the bigger picture, including life factors, in mind. I recall seeing a book about social on your bookshelf, I forgot to ask you about it. Would appreciate if you could share sometime. After this intense dual career search process is complete, I hope to have a bit more time for reading. And the relaxing suggestions that you had too, that would be great.

Best,
vineet

Hi Garrett,

It was great to meet you during the visit to BU. Enjoyed the idea exchange during the seminar and the one on one too. Thanks for the espresso, was very timely and much needed. I think the multimodal learning models would be very interesting, I’m wondering if we can get some kind of interpretability in the text in a more principled way that would make it more about the product rather than preferences. Happy to kick around some ideas sometime over coffee.

I think you have a really nice group doing very interesting and excellent research. I had met the seniors earlier in conferences but very glad I got the opportunity to meet with the juniors as well now.

Best,
vineet

Hi Carey,

Thanks again for inviting me to visit BU as your first speaker in the fall. You have a really good group doing impressive and meaningful research, on both quant and cb areas. Really enjoyed the seminar, great questions and ideas from the audience that I also had a chance to explore in the one on one meetings. You had also asked me some of those during our one on one earlier, especially about going outside the bounds of data, so it was great to see how we could explore some of those issues in the future. 
The interpretability aspect with AI that I’ve tried to focus on seems particularly relevant for automated decision making, one of the aspects of AI that I think we’re probably going to see more of like self-driving cars I guess. There was an interesting series in the WSJ on Tesla’s crashses, not sure if you’ve seen that:

BTW, I heard you live in Cambridge too (I’m close to the Harvard design school), would be nice to grab a coffee or drink sometime. I’m doing a search this fall, but expect to be a bit more relaxed after that.

Best,
vineet
