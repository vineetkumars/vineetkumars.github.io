Hi Juanjuan,

Hope you are doing great. I just wanted to thank you again your kind support in my current job search. Your recommendation would be valued greatly by the field in support of my applications. I've sent an official request through Interfolio, and would be grateful if you could upload that when you get a chance.

By the way, thank you too for connecting me with Nikolas for the MIT process. He was incredibly nice and super helpful, above and beyond what I've experienced.

Best,
vineet

Hi Girish,

It was great to see you at AMA yesterday. Hope you had a good conference and return home. Really appreciate your update on the timeline, and thank you so much for your interest in my case. I look forward to the posting, and to staying in touch. Best wishes for the fall term.

Regards,
Vineet

Dear Dipankar,

Thank you so much for taking the time to talk with me last week. I was wondering if you might have some time in the coming week for a follow up chat. If it's easier to coordinate on phone, my phone (and whatsapp) number is +1.412.273.5492.

Please let me know what times might work best for you. I'm flexible Mon-Wed this week, after which I'm traveling to the QME conference.

Best,
vineet
