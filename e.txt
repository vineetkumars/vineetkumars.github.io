Hi Bilal,

It was great talking with you today. I really enjoyed our conversation, and learned a lot about the research culture in the department, and at the school of management at UCL. I really appreciated your focus on both the substantive area, and the importance of quality of research. It seems like a very good time to be in the department, with impressive faculty doing important, relevant and high-quality work. Being housed in a broad-based university like you mentioned also permits excellent opportunities for collaboration.

I'm particularly enthusiastic after our conversation about the opportunities available at UCL to establish a new phase of my academic career. I would greatly appreciate if you could share a sense of your process and timeline as it takes shape, and very much look forward to staying in touch.

Best,
vineet
