Dear Faculty Support Team,

I was wondering if someone could please check my office 5455 for keys on my desk. I recall leaving a pair of keys on my desk, but am not sure. The keys should be directly on the desk, to the right of the monitor, to the best of my recollection.

I'd greatly appreciate if you could check and let me know.

Best,
Vineet

Dear Sunil,

Thanks, I look forward to meeting you too. I was planning to travel internationally the past few days, but have had to postpone my trip to July 17-27. So sorry for the delayed response.

July 14 - 17 (Mon -- Wed).
July 28 - Aug 1

If those don't work for you, please feel free to suggest. I'm fairly flexible in terms of time, so please feel free to pick what works for you.

Best,
vineet

Dear Bilal,

I hope you are doing well. I'm really looking forward to connecting with you to learn more about UCL, thank you for taking the time.

I wanted to request if we might be able to change the time of our meeting. Unfortunately, I was not able to travel this weekend like planned, and will instead be leaving Wednesday (July 16) night from the US. So I am available:
July 14-16 (US Eastern Time, 5 hours behind London)
July 18-24 (India, 4.5 hours ahead of London)

My sincere apologies for the inconvenience, and look forward to talking soon. 

Best,
Vineet
