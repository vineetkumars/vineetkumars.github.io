Hi Adam,

It was great to meet you during my visit to BC. Really enjoyed the interactive seminar given your expertise in visual research, I really like to idea of figuring out what are the fundamental factors of variation picked up by the ML algorithm and how they connect to more fundamental geometric constructs (edge detection and contrast etc. like you mention). These could allow richer and I think more principled variation in the generative space, something that would be very helpful to explore in the future.

Enjoyed our lunch conversation too, and it seems like you have a really nice and collegial group, that's something to be very much appreciated. Trust you had a good post-camp experience with family, and look forward to having our paths cross in the near future.

Best,

Hi Kay,

It was wonderful to meet with you after hearing so much about you over the years, starting at HBS and beyond. I've admired your work in customer relationships and broadly your career arc and was very glad that I got the chance to finally meet you during the visit. I really enjoyed both the interactive seminar (thank you for the very interesting and helpful questions) as well as our follow-up discussion at lunch.

Thank you so much for helping me better understand the culture of the school and group at BC. I think you have a very nice and growing group, and enjoyed meeting everyone in the group.

Best,

Hi Henrik,

Really enjoyed meeting with you and learning about your unique background in art before entering marketing academia. I was very much looking forward to interacting during the seminar, given your expertise in visual. It was even better interaction than I had anticipated, and learned quite a bit from the exchange, and have cool follow-ups to think carefully about.

I think there could be some interesting opportunities to explore some features of art using these methods, to try and understand how people respond perhaps to specific "features" that are informed by domain knowledge. I do hope our paths cross soon, and look forward to that. BTW, I really enjoyed looking at your paintings both when we met, and now online.

Best,

Hi Ronnie,

I truly enjoyed meeting with you and learning more about the values that you hold close at the Carroll school at BC. During my PhD at Carnegie Mellon (when Rick was the head of the PhD program), I recall very similar values that were instilled in terms of being very careful and thoughtful about evaluating intellectual contributions in research. I can understand how Finance has grown to be such a highly-regarded powerhouse group under your leadership. The other groups have an excellent opportunity to make a substantial impact, and I fully expect your guidance to be crucial in taking this trajectory.

I enjoyed meeting folks in the Marketing group, and got the sense of  evolution and growth, especially on the quantitative side with many joining recently. There are some very natural complementarities in research that I see with the faculty, that I would want to explore. I hope to connect soon to learn more, and look forward to our paths cross in the near future. 

Best,

Hi Kanishka,

Thanks again for inviting me to the seminar at BC and for being a wonderful host including at drinks and dinner. I very much enjoyed the interactive seminar with lots of (good) questions. It's great to see how you are building a nice quant group with a lot of potential to make an impact, and it's wonderful to see the school and the Dean's office so supportive of that.

I'll keep you updated on the BLP with visual characteristics that we are currently working on, I am particularly excited about that project. 

Hope to catch up in the near future.

Best,
vineet
