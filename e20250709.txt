Dear Yiting (bcc), I really enjoyed our chat, thank you for connecting with Bilal.

Dear Bilal,

It's wonderful to meet you over email. I'm currently a faculty member at Yale School of Management. I was wondering if you might have some time for a quick chat to learn about UCL? Kindly let me know what times work best for you. I've included my CV below, and look forward to connecting with you.

Best,

Dear Jaideep,

I hope this note finds you well. I'm currently a faculty member at Yale in marketing. I spoke with Ahmed Khwaja regarding Cambridge and more broadly, the UK academic market, with my interest due to both professional and personal reasons. We've known each other from his time at Yale.

I was wondering if you might be available for a quick chat. I would very much appreciate the opportunity to have a conversation. I've attached my CV here as well.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best Regards,
Vineet

Dear Naufel,

I hope you are doing well. I had been talking with Pradeep and others about the UK market, and I wanted to reach out to you to follow up. I'm guessing you may have heard about my situation at Yale already.

I was wondering if you might have some time for a chat in the coming days. I'm including my CV here, and I would very much appreciate your advice and suggestions, and also hope to learn a bit about LSE and the academic environment in the UK.

Best Regards,
Vineet

Dear Prasad,

It was great to catch up at both Marketing Dynamics in Goa and at Marketing Science earlier this summer. I don't know how you magically make Dynamics such a great success!

I wanted to share my CV with you, and would appreciate if you could share as you think appropriate. At this time, I am on the market looking for a landing place where the family would be happy.

Thanks again for your kind support.

Best Regards,
Vineet
