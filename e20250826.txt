Hi Brett,

Hope you are doing well. Thank you for thinking of me as reviewer for this paper.

Currently, I'm starting the job search process. Most campus visits are (or will be) scheduled in Sep -- Oct. I have a few international ones too (Asia/Europe).

Given all this, I was thinking it might be a bit challenging to get the review completed in a timely manner. I'd be happy to review after my job search concludes, likely before or around mid-November. However, if you think my input would be helpful for the process, I'd be glad to do the review. 

Feel free to call or msg me if that's helpful, +1.412.273.5492.

Best,
vineet

Dear Bilal,

Great to hear from you, and hope you are doing well. Thank you for inviting me to visit UCL, this is wonderful news. I would, of course, be delighted to visit and meet all of you, and get to know the department and school.

I do have a question about timing. I need to apply for a UK visa to visit, so I was wondering if the September timeframe might prove a bit challenging, and perhaps sometime October might be more certain, given the processing time. It would be great to get your thoughts on this matter.

It would be helpful if I could get an official invitation letter, so that I could apply for the visa. Look forward to connecting with you soon, and to meeting you in the coming weeks.

Best,
vineet
