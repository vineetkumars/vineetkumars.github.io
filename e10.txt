Hi Keith,

Hope you are doing well. Thank you for your kind attention to the market structure mapping paper, and your suggestion to submit as an MSI working paper.

Our apologies for the delayed response. We have been traveling internationally to attend Marketing Dynamics, in fact, to present this paper. As a result of the feedback we have received, including at the conference, we are currently revising the paper, and expect to have a substantially updated version in about a week.

We would be very glad to submit the paper for your consideration in about a week. I think it would be great to see the paper featured as an MSI working paper. Would that timeline for an updated version work for you? Kindly let us know.

Best,
Vineet (for the authors)
