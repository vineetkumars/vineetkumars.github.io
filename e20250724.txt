Dear Om,

Hope you are doing well. I'm currently a faculty member in marketing at Yale, and am really looking forward to connecting with you. I have been talking with with Naufel, given my keen interest in LSE. I've learned a bit through these conversations both about LSE and about life in the UK overall, and am hoping I can meet you soon to understand the group and your focus and priorities going forward.

Separately, Nitin Mehta also speaks very highly of you, and he also suggested that I reach out to talk with you.

I am currently in India (Bangalore) until Saturday evening (July 26), visiting for a research collaboration here. I return to the US (Eastern Time) on Sunday (July 27). 

In case it is more convenient, you can also reach me on phone or WhatsApp at +1.412.273.5492.

I am very much looking forward to talking with you.

Best Regards,
Vineet
