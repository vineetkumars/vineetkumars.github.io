**For the Dean:**

Dear Martijn,

I wanted to take a moment to express my heartfelt gratitude for hosting me at the University 
of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business. On a personal note, I truly appreciate that you thoughtfully suggested a walk through campus on a beautiful spring afternoon, and helped me better understand the storied history and roots of the institution. I could not have imagined a better start to my visit.

Your vision for the college, and the clarity of thought with which you laid out the priorities and focus areas for the future was inspiring. The focus on research, the undergraduate program and the flagship MBA program are all essential pillars that provide a strong foundation for the school’s unique identity and long-term reputation. I especially appreciated your idea to further develop the flagship MBA program by focusing on the quality, rather than quantity. I feel fortunate to have had the opportunity to learn more about your initiatives firsthand.

It was an absolute pleasure to present my seminar and engage with the faculty and staff across multiple departments. The interactions during my seminar and in meetings with faculty made it clear to me that intellectual curiosity and a vibrant research culture lie at the heart of the research culture at Mendoza.

I was very impressed by the college's strong focus on research and its commitment to building deep and meaningful relationships with university alumni, who have demonstrated strong support of labs and even PhD programs. I think these unique and valuable collaborations provide a wonderful opportunity to futher elevate research across the departments in the college, as well as building interdisciplinary opportunities.

Thank you again for your warm hospitality and for making my visit so enjoyable. I look forward to staying in touch!

Best regards,
Vineet

Dear Ken,

I wanted to take a moment to express my sincere gratitude for hosting me at the Notre Dame. It was an absolute pleasure to be on your beautiful campus and engage with the faculty, both intellectually and socially.

I really liked how you laid out your top priorities (research,…)! It was great to learn from our conversation about how the college's research initiatives work symbiotically alongside a commitment to building strong relationships with alumni. This is evident from how alums have supported the center you direct with Ahmed, as well as the PhD program at ITAO. 

Your insights about the college's strong positioning and research trajectory were very thoughtful and provide a strong foundation to help faculty achieve success. I was also impressed by the welcoming environment and potential opportunities for interdisciplinary collaborations. The seminar brought to life the engaging intellectual environment, and my individual meetings with the faculty reinforced that experience.

Thank you again for your hospitality and for making my visit so enjoyable. I look forward to staying in touch and meeting again in the near future.

Best regards,
Vineet

Dear Frank,

I wanted to express my sincere gratitude for hosting me at Notre Dame, and for planning such a nice visit. It was very thoughtful to have a welcome gift bag with art including the dome, and other ND memorabilia. I also appreciated the wonderful opportunities to explore the campus, first with Martijn and then with Jeff.

The seminar was more interactive than I had anticipated, which is wonderful, and I appreciated your thought-provoking and insightful questions, including on some of the different future directions the research can take. It was great to see the engagement and enthusiasm with regard to research. My sense of the strong research culture at the college was further reinforced in meetings with faculty, both in Marketing and outside.

I really enjoyed meeting individually with you in the evening to learn about the impressive trajectory of the department under your leadership, including the promotion and tenure cases recently. Congratulations on these noteworthy milestones! Also impressive is the commitment to fostering a collegial department environment, and how the research-focused direction is evolving. With the wonderful set of alumni who have strong relationships with the institution, there seem to be a lot of possibilities for building upon this foundation.

The dinner with you and John was such a highlight for me, with wonderful conversation and food. I learned a lot about the faculty experience living in the South Bend / Granger area, and see a lot of potential that would not have been apparent.

Thank you again for your warm hospitality and for making my visit so enjoyable. I look forward to staying in touch and connecting in the near future.

Best regards,
Vineet

Dear Joe,

I wanted to thank you for the wonderful visit to Notre Dame. During the visit, I really got to experience your wonderful collegial culture, as well as the strong focus and engagement with research ideas  at the department and college.

I really appreciated your engagement during the talk, and your keen questions, including about connecting visual characteristics with market data. We are planning a follow-up project exploring how visual characteristics impact consumer preferences and choices, and consequently market data.  Great to know you already saw the potential value in making that connection! There are some interesting methodological issues that arise in how we can attribute unobservable characteristics to visual versus other non-visual characteristics like durability that are not directly observed. We want to work through these carefully to ensure we are capturing the appropriate effects.

I really enjoyed meeting with you one-on-one too. You had suggested a company that works on fashion as a possible connection (I can’t recall the name). I would be very interesting in exploring that to see if they and you see value in an academic collaboration. I think there are a bunch of possibilities for experimentation too. I look forward to staying in touch.

Best,
Vineet
