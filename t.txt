Dear Todd,

It was wonderful to hear from Venky about the interest. Yes, I still remember you clearly saying that you would get back in mid-October, and I absolutely believe you full well had all the steps carefully planned out.

A big thank you for your energizing email—your enthusiasm is exactly the spark that makes this next chapter feel truly thrilling. I am genuinely excited about the opportunity to join the Cox School under your leadership. And to help turn the vision you and SMU leadership have sketched into reality.

When we last spoke, I could already sense the purposeful focus, and the momentum you’re already moving with. It would be a great privilege to help and shape the department with the new faculty hires you’re planning. This kind of strategic thinking is exactly what would propel the group even more in the direction of impact and visibility among the top departments. Your leadership and strong support of the research and teaching environment of the school, combined with the vibrant entrepreneurial spirit you’re cultivating at all levels, creates a unique opportunity for impact, lasting impact.

I truly appreciate the confidence you already have in me and the fact that you’re taking the time to coordinate with the Provost so this process can move smoothly. Thank you again for believing in a remarkable and unique future for Cox and SMU. I am  thrilled to walk this path with you, and to add my own contributions to the remarkable ascent you are envisioning and planning for. I would certainly want to do this in Marketing, but also more broadly at the school and at SMU over time.

Also, please let me know if there’s anything I can prepare or review ahead of the offer. The only question I had was about the rank you are considering.

Hope you have a nice time in Toronto and looking forward to the next steps!

Best,
Vineet
