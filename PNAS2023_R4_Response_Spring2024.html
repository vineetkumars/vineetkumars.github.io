   The paper is a very careful and elegant analysis of a new way of characterizing an easily measurable proxy for
a structural network feature we know is important. I am recommending that we approve publication once the
issues identified below have been addressed. Please accept my apologies for the delay in reaching a
decision with respect to this manuscript. You can see the quite extensive and helpful comments of
Reviewer 1 which have shaped my thinking, along with consultation with experts in areas of network
science for which I am less expert. I want to thank you for the careful revision previously, and for your
patience.
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   As Reviewer 1 nicely demonstrates with the clique removal example, inversity and assortativity are closely
related but not identical ways of considering the interconnectedness of a static network topology. Is it possible that
both of these measures ultimately boil down to the uniformity/skewness of density sampling for arbitrarily chosen
vertex subsets, contrasting a focal individual against some scale of alternative induced subgraph density to
characterize the evenness of the distribution of that ratio (i.e., focal individual vs induced subsample). If this is the
case, then both are reasonable proxies for a marginally less accessible &#8221;why&#8221; for the observed behaviors.
Please look at work such as     <a 
href="https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1900219116" class="url" ><span 
class="pcrr7t-x-x-120">https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1900219116</span></a> and cite as
appropriate.
<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   You set the local vs global (as a general point, this is really not global and it would be good to call
it something else) measures as alternatives for assessing individual measure of responsibility for
network-wide propagation of an infectious process and then saying that the global measure is entirely novel,
even though it&#8217;s just a relaxation of the &#8221;local&#8221; measure. Further, assortativity is closely related to
network modularity, and both assortativity and inversity are easily related to so called &#8221;bridge nodes&#8221;
(nodes that act as conduit connectors between modular communities). Modularity, bridge-node based
methods, and related generalizations along these lines have been rather well studied already as a
means of characterizing likely individuals for efficient spread/interruption, including consideration of
local-only information. While most of these studies have been simulation based (Salathe and Jones 2010
and Gupta, Singh, and Cherifi 2016 both spring to mind), a few have also provided some analytic
results. The implication here is to tone down the claims to novelty and connect more with cognate
literatures.
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   The key issue from Reviewer 1 that needs to be addressed is: what kind of networks are you operating with?
The Reviewer consideration of 3000 sociograms of different sorts which shows that while inversity is not the same
as assortativity, it is very close (R2 0.97). begs the question of what is going on in figure S6 where you have cases
where both are strongly positive - like about 0.5 where your series crosses over. As Reviewer 1 notes, these
networks, whatever those networks look like, are not representative of the sorts of social networks we
bump into regularly. To avoid building a metric around weird edge cases, please produce an inset
sociogram or some such for figure s6 that makes clear what sort of structure generates the cases you
find.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   Please attend to the other issues raised by Reviewer 1 as well, which would take another couple of pages to
summarize.
<!--l. 39--><p class="indent" >   These changes aside, there is much to be enthusiastic about in this paper. Both reviewers agree that &#8221;inversity&#8221;
is a natural thing that has not yet been named or studied as its own thing. It is a simple metric that allows a slightly
different understanding of how to evaluate mesoscale network structure using local information that seems quite
valuable as a contribution on its own. It is always exciting to discover something, and I commend
you.

   This revision has been informative and I appreciate that the authors have taken great pains to defend their
measure. I have a great deal of respect for this authorship team; they are well-versed in the issues and clearly know
what they are doing. One could probably not ask for a more qualified team to investigate this question. This is a
case where asking for what I thought would be fairly trivial clarifications just seems to keep pulling up new
questions. To some degree, that is a good thing: it means there is substantive, non- obvious meat here worth the
attention of scholars digging into &#8211; so we should take it for what it is and let the field sort it out. We might recall,
for example, that we spent years using the complex formulation for Burt&#8217;s &#8220;effective size&#8221; measure (profitably),
only to discover after Borgatti&#8217;s 1997 paper that it is &#8220;merely&#8221; ego&#8217;s degree minus the average of
alter&#8217;s degree (and similar simplifications for constraint). That simplification didn&#8217;t undo the value of
knowing what effective size was, nor undermine the theoretical logic that got us to it. My guess is that
there&#8217;s something similar here: you have discovered a property of the moments of friends-of-friends
that taps into the imbalance of edgewise shared degree that is interesting and important, and it&#8217;s
captured well with the Pearson correlation of deg(i),1/deg(j). While I&#8217;m not convinced that something
as mathematically idiosyncratic as the Pearson correlation, will be, in the end, the actual driving
feature here &#8211; its just too arbitrary &#8211; I&#8217;m convinced that what&#8217;s here is useful and not incorrect so
worth moving forward on. That said...there are a couple of (please let them be..) minor points worth
clarifying.

      size &#8211; and since this is a network generation process defined by linking stars to cliques (by description, I
      can&#8217;t figure out exactly what you did to replicate it), clearly the effect is strongly conditioned by the size of

           Figure S6, it is not just the size of the network that is changing, but the structure is changing.
           Specifically, we keep the cliques constant and vary only the size of the single star network.
           Thus, there are two aspects of the network that are changing. First is the size of the network.
           Second is the proportion of the network that belongs to the star component. Thus, this figure is
           not an appropriate one to infer anything about scale-invariance.

class="ptmb7t-x-x-120">What is actually driving this metric and is there a substantive difference with assortativity?</span>
      Assortativity answers a natural question naturally &#8211; we want to know how similar ego is to alter? The
      correlation is fine. Could just as well use a standardized difference score, but correlation puts it in a nice
      metric. Nothing depends on the exact parameterization for the sorts of questions people ask of it.
      <br 
class="newline" />
      <!--l. 84--><p class="noindent" >For inversity you flip it: how similar is ego to the inverse of alter? And 1/deg(j) is non-linear, so (at least to
      me) not intuitive. The main difference between corr(deg(i),deg(j)) and corr(deg(i),1/deg(j)) is easily seen in
      a scatterplot. Consider a generalization of your figure 1, panel (a) where the network is a collection of
      cliques of different sizes. Here ranging from dyads (collections of degree=1) to (arbitrarily) 15 (degree=14).
      The baseline scatterplot and scores are as at right. The assortativity scatter in blue using the left y axis,
      inversity in red indexed on the right y axis. So assortativity is perfect, but because 1/deg(j) is curved in
      deg(j), the score is not perfect (it&#8217;s -0.76). Now that lack-of-fit is not really informative in the natural
      correlation sense &#8211; we shouldn&#8217;t expect a linear association measure to capture a non-linear functional
      form.
      <!--l. 90--><p class="noindent" >Now let&#8217;s just delete some of those middling cliques so that we no longer have the full range and see what
      happens: The font is a little small (sorry about that) but the pattern is obvious: assortativity stays constant,
      and inversity ranges arbitrarily close to -1.0 depending on the mix of cliques included. This is, of course,
      implied by eq 4 &#8211; as the selection of cliques is affecting the moments of the degree distribution, which is
      what drives the score (and it must also drive assortativity, I&#8217;d think?). So is this a feature or a bug? Is there
      any substantive difference between these cases? The dominant feature is a collection of cliques. Inversity
      varies across the cases because a collection of 1/d cases contribute more of that curve the more
                                                                                                
                                                                                                
      complete the range of d included in the network. When there are only 2 classes of numbers
      (isolated dyads and a big clique), there are only two points on the plane, and the correlation is
      perfect. To get positive inversity, you need hubs and pendants. Then the scatter will have a lot of
      points at degree=1 (all the pendants), each with alters having degree <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E; </span><span 
class="cmr-12">1 </span>which implies an
      inverse-degree is <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003C;&#x003C; </span><span 
class="cmr-12">1 </span>generating a blur of points at x=1 and y <span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003C;</span>small<span 
class="cmmi-12">&#x003E;</span>. The hubs then have
      <span 
class="cmmi-12">x &#x003E;&#x003E; </span><span 
class="cmr-12">1 </span>and at least some mass at <span 
class="cmmi-12">y </span><span 
class="cmr-12">= 1 </span>(inverse degree of a pendant=1), creating a positive
      association.
      <!--l. 105--><p class="noindent" >And again we can play the same sort of game where we limit the collection of stars to get arbitrarily close to
      -1.0, though unlike the clique case here we also get variance in assortativity, so that seems a
      reasonable (if uninteresting) mapping, but again the issue is that the underlying feature here is that
      the graph needs many star-like substructures to generate a positive inversity. My instinct is
      something like this might be useful to spell out clearly in the supplement (perhaps more so than S3,
      at least for me). Now in all of these cases, the assortativity and inversity scores are strongly
      negatively correlated. They are not constant &#8211; in part because (as we see in the example for cliques)
      inversity varies based on the collection of sizes included &#8211; so in all those cases assortativity is
      constant (1.0) and inversity is not. Again, you claim this as a feature and (since we rarely see
      collections of cliques) I&#8217;m willing to give the benefit of the doubt on that. I&#8217;ve run the scores over
      about 3000 real-life networks from different domains that I happen to have on hand, which
      includes coauthorship, adolescent networks, village networks and some sundry others. I get
      this:
      <!--l. 120--><p class="noindent" >So inversity is not the same as assortativity, but darn that&#8217;s close (the R2 of a simple regression model is
      0.97). Color here is data source, so a lot of variation across types of networks. And you can see, for
      example, that there are cases where both have the same sign &#8211; right there around zero. The
      difference between the local mean and the global mean generally gets smaller the closer you
      get to the origin point there...so effectively this is a noise region. In figure S6 you seem to
      have cases where both are strongly positive &#8211; like about 0.5 where your series crosses over.
      Whatever those networks look like, they are not representative of the sorts of social networks I
      bump into regularly. So what? I think you (reasonably) want to push the idea that these are
      fundamentally different critters to signal value to your method. I would just temper that &#8211; in the
      sorts of settings where you might want to do an intervention (the 75 villages data is in this
      set, for example) &#8211; they don&#8217;t seem that different, and you don&#8217;t want to build an argument
      around edge-cases. (That said, you should probably produce an inset sociogram or some such for
      figure s6 that makes clear what sort of structure generates the at-least-to-me odd cases you
      find).

   Having reviewed the response to reviewers and the updated manuscript, I think the authors have done a good
job in responding to the issues raised (and, particularly, why assortativity and inversity are related but distinct
measures). I think the manuscript makes a very interesting contribution to the field, and the inversity measure is
likely to trigger new work; I support publication.
