Hi Tanisha,

Hope you've had a nice weekend. I was looking at the workday request and had questions about the per diem for the India trip. I think the numbers do not correspond to what I had computed.

The report was for:
13 days in Bengaluru (also called Bangalore), India
Meals and Incidentals.

It seems like the rate varies across cities in India. Could you please double check and let me know what rate was used for Bengaluru, India? Or correct it if needed?
Thanks for your help with this matter.

Best,
vineet
