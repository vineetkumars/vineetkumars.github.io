<p><b>Research Statement</b></p>
<p>Vineet Kumar,<i> Yale School</i></p>
<p><i>of Management</i></p>
<p>My overall</p>
<p>research focus is at the intersection of</p>
<p>technology and business &amp; society.</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>Digital</p>
<p>technology has had substantial impact on consumers,</p>
<p>firms and society.</p>
<p>Given my background in</p>
<p>both engineering and business, I am especially interested in two focus areas.</p>
<p>(A)<i> Digital</i></p>
<p><i>business models</i> have specific features relative to the markets for commonly studied</p>
<p>goods.</p>
<p>My research focuses on strategic long-run choices relevant to digital</p>
<p>firms,</p>
<p>a topic of</p>
<p>interest to multiple fields.</p>
<p>I study this area using methods based on microfoundations of agents’</p>
<p>preferences, typically empirical structural models.</p>
<p>(B) Building<i> theory-based machine learning (ML)</i> methods incorporating structured knowledge</p>
<p>(theory) developed from first principles to be human interpretable, and provide representations</p>
<p>satisfying required properties (e.g.</p>
<p>monotonicity).</p>
<p>These methods also enable new business</p>
<p>models (creating new sources of value).</p>
<p><b>(A) Digital Business Models</b></p>
<p>The business model</p>
<p>of a firm denotes a set of integrated strategic choices that drive performance</p>
<p>in the marketplace.</p>
<p>With traditional products, these models are well established; digital offers new</p>
<p>possibilities (e.g.</p>
<p>freemium,</p>
<p>versioning,</p>
<p>social</p>
<p>etc.)</p>
<p>that deserve careful</p>
<p>study;</p>
<p>these choices and</p>
<p>their alignment provide the foundation for success or failure.</p>
<p>Within digital business models, my research can broadly be themed as focusing on three different</p>
<p>sources of connections:</p>
<p>between<i> products</i>,<i> consumers</i> and<i> data</i>.</p>
<p><i><b>1) Connections across Products – Product Line</b></i></p>
<p>I detail the connections between products, with a research overview and agenda provided in [P1].</p>
<p><i>Bundling Hardware and Software:</i></p>
<p>In [P4],</p>
<p>I examine the dynamic effects of bundling in digital</p>
<p>platforms (hardware+software).</p>
<p>Should a firm create mixed bundles (products+bundles),</p>
<p>pure</p>
<p>bundles,</p>
<p>or no bundles? I investigate the dynamics of bundling using data on sales and product</p>
<p>characteristics in markets for videogame consoles (hardware) and game titles (software).</p>
<p>In dynamic</p>
<p>settings with intertemporal tradeoffs, bundling is more effective with<i> positive correlation</i> of valua-</p>
<p>tion across products.</p>
<p>Bundles act by pulling demand forward, i.e.</p>
<p>consumers buy now rather than</p>
<p>wait,</p>
<p>a new mechanism,</p>
<p>and higher sales obtain with positive correlation.</p>
<p>Prior to this research,</p>
<p>bundling was studied in a static setup and found to be more effective with negative correlation.</p>
<p>I also show that bundling is more effective when indirect network effects are weaker.</p>
<p>I develop a</p>
<p>novel</p>
<p>identification strategy for correlation in valuations based on the tying ratio,</p>
<p>leveraging the</p>
<p>market feature that consumers purchase one hardware unit, but many software units.</p>
<p><i>Versioning:</i></p>
<p>Freemium is the most popular digital business model (e.g.</p>
<p>app stores, cloud storage,</p>
<p>1</p>
<p>For simplicity of exposition,</p>
<p>this document is written stylistically in the first person singular,</p>
<p>although most of</p>
<p>my work is in collaboration with a wonderful set of co-authors.</p>

<p>SaaS). I provide an overview of issues in Freemium for a general audience in [P11].</p>
<p>Few consumers</p>
<p>(typically<i> &lt;</i>5%) migrate to the paid version, so product design is of critical importance.</p>
<p>I undertake</p>
<p>a deep dive into designing freemium for a storage service,</p>
<p>examining the growth-monetization</p>
<p>tradeoff.</p>
<p>In [P16],</p>
<p>I evaluate product design (value of free version) and referral</p>
<p>incentives,</p>
<p>which</p>
<p>impact the value of the free product, and therefore, upgrades.</p>
<p>In counterfactuals, I find that offering</p>
<p>a greater referral bonus relative to the firm’s bonus can increase growth but reduce monetization,</p>
<p>while beyond a threshold, it can decrease both growth and monetization.</p>
<p>I study how to optimally</p>
<p>structure dynamic referral incentives.</p>
<p>I examine the strategic use of</p>
<p>time as a versioning and monetization strategy (wait for free)</p>
<p>in [P18].</p>
<p>This strategy is commonly employed by platforms publishing content (e.g.</p>
<p>novels as</p>
<p>serialized episodes),</p>
<p>with consumers having complementary value for content across episodes.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>leverage a natural</p>
<p>experiment – wait time is reduced by the platform – to study the impact on</p>
<p>downstream consumer choices.</p>
<p>Existing consumers were found to increase paid consumption, and</p>
<p>more new consumers start reading, increasing aggregate consumption.</p>
<p>I show how a microfounded</p>
<p>mechanism with complementarity can rationalize these data patterns.</p>
<p>Overall,</p>
<p>this demonstrates</p>
<p>the strategic role of temporal versioning in driving choices, which has not been shown earlier.</p>
<p><i>Digital</i></p>
<p><i>Transformation</i>:</p>
<p>In [P10], I study digital transformation strategy for a firm moving from</p>
<p>one offering to another, typically a product based on an older technology (physical) to one based on</p>
<p>newer technology (digital).</p>
<p>I examine pricing and product design in this empirical setting.</p>
<p>Using</p>
<p>a panel</p>
<p>from the “Netflix” model,</p>
<p>I obtain consumer preferences for viewing content in physical</p>
<p>form, and evaluate optimally pricing the product line.</p>
<p>The product line contains multiple versions,</p>
<p>which allow the firm to extract surplus from heterogeneous consumers.</p>
<p>However, as the service time</p>
<p>is reduced,</p>
<p>the differentiation across versions also decreases.</p>
<p>In counterfactuals,</p>
<p>I uncover novel</p>
<p>mechanisms demonstrating how improved service time (better for all</p>
<p>customers) could result in</p>
<p>lower profits and even lower revenue for the firm under optimal pricing, a previously unappreciated</p>
<p>transformation risk.</p>
<p><i>Open Source:</i></p>
<p>I examine the market for open source software [P14],</p>
<p>where products made by</p>
<p>competing firms share common elements.</p>
<p>Open source contributions made either by developers</p>
<p>or by any firm are available to all</p>
<p>competing firms (e.g.</p>
<p>Linux or Android).</p>
<p>It is puzzling that</p>
<p>encouraging free-riding can lead to high quality products;</p>
<p>my model with interconnected markets</p>
<p>(developer and product) explains how this happens.</p>
<p>Developers signal their capabilities by making</p>
<p>contributions of</p>
<p>features to the open source software (public good).</p>
<p>Free-riding is sustained in</p>
<p>equilibrium since firms can build on features to differentiate on another complementary dimen-</p>
<p>sion (usability);</p>
<p>I find that appropriability can even increase product quality,</p>
<p>in contrast to what</p>
<p>industry leaders believed.</p>
<p>2</p>
<p><i><b>2) Connections across Data – Linking Purchase and Usage</b></i></p>
<p>The third connection that I examine is the linkage between types of data, i.e.</p>
<p>purchase data and</p>
<p>usage data.</p>
<p>In digital settings, usage data is uniquely available, and valuable in obtaining insights</p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>about consumer preferences.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>most studies in marketing and economics involve only</p>
<p>purchase data.</p>
<p>I connect usage and purchase data across several</p>
<p>settings,</p>
<p>including [P16,</p>
<p>P10].</p>
<p>In [P3],</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>demonstrate how usage data is conceptually distinct,</p>
<p>and is critically important for</p>
<p>identification,</p>
<p>not just estimation.</p>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<p>I show that identification of</p>
<p>the Willingness to</p>
<p>Pay (WTP) distribution for subscriptions without price variation is possible by leveraging usage</p>
<p>data,</p>
<p>but impossible without it.</p>
<p>The key insight is that combining high-frequency usage data</p>
<p>with purchase data allows for a conceptual</p>
<p>leap in identification of</p>
<p>the distribution of</p>
<p>consumer</p>
<p>willingness-to-pay (WTP), which was not thought to be possible without price variation.</p>
<p>I combine</p>
<p>usage data with exogenous factors impacting usage to first estimate usage utility,</p>
<p>then aggregate</p>
<p>this stream,</p>
<p>combined with purchase data to obtain the WTP distribution.</p>
<p>I can then conduct</p>
<p>counterfactual</p>
<p>analyses,</p>
<p>such as product design.</p>
<p>The framework is flexible in accommodating a</p>
<p>large class of usage utility models, making it widely applicable.</p>
<p><i><b>3) Connections across Consumers – Networks</b></i></p>
<p>Word-of-mouth and referral</p>
<p>effects can impact business models.</p>
<p>However,</p>
<p>my research here is</p>
<p>broadly applicable to a wide class of network interventions beyond that.</p>
<p>I investigate privacy-sensitive methods for leveraging network structure to obtain higher-degree</p>
<p>nodes in unknown networks [P15],</p>
<p>e.g.</p>
<p>for word-of-mouth.</p>
<p>The literature focuses on obtaining</p>
<p>the entire network structure (not privacy-friendly!),</p>
<p>and also does not offer provable guarantees.</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>examine two strategies (ego-based and alter-based),</p>
<p>based on the friendship paradox,</p>
<p>asking</p>
<p>individuals to nominate random friends.</p>
<p>I show that these strategies have distinct mathematical</p>
<p>properties,</p>
<p>and also propose a new network property called Inversity,</p>
<p>which determines which</p>
<p>strategy obtains better connected seeds, based on network structure.</p>
<p>The strategies are simple to</p>
<p>implement and offer provable guarantees of obtaining higher-degree individuals.</p>
<p>I empirically study whether using friendship paradox strategies can achieve greater adoption in</p>
<p>[P13].</p>
<p>Using a model of communication and adoption across social networks estimated on data, I</p>
<p>evaluate counterfactual</p>
<p>seeding strategies.</p>
<p>I show that ego-based friendship seeding outperforms</p>
<p>random seeding,</p>
<p>and surprisingly,</p>
<p>obtains higher adoption than even leader-based seeding.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>results hold across a range of specifications and networks, demonstrating robustness and empirical</p>
<p>value,</p>
<p>and have implications for referral</p>
<p>design.</p>
<p>In contrast to prior work,</p>
<p>this research proves</p>
<p>that it is possible to leverage networks to impact interventions with guarantees for<i> any</i> network,</p>
<p>without knowing the network.</p>
<p><b>Methodological Overview and Contributions:</b></p>
<p>Theory or structured knowledge is central to</p>
<p>my microfounded models.</p>
<p>This structural</p>
<p>approach yields estimates with clear economic inter-</p>
<p>pretations,</p>
<p>enabling the counterfactual evaluation of firm or regulatory policies.</p>
<p>During the work</p>
<p>on some of the above projects,</p>
<p>I investigated methods for estimating dynamic demand models in</p>
<p>technology markets.</p>
<p>Examining the commonly used inclusive value approach,</p>
<p>I show that it can</p>
<p>lead to highly biased estimates of economically important quantities like elasticity and profits [P5].</p>
<p>Motivated by the need for models to flexibly accommodate dynamics with large state spaces,</p>
<p>I</p>

<p>Page 3 of 7</p>
<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p>develop a new method with lower computational</p>
<p>complexity that can be easily estimated [P2].</p>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<p>for a large class of problems (with terminating or renewal</p>
<p>choice) using market-level</p>
<p>data,</p>
<p>it obtains consumer preferences with the computational</p>
<p>complexity of</p>
<p>a linear regression.</p>
<p>Identification is proven formally and the method can be used for counterfactual analysis.</p>
<p><b>(B) Theory-based Machine Learning</b></p>
<p>My research focus in ML is based on integrating structured knowledge to develop better ML</p>
<p>methods, which in turn, enables us to obtain insights about consumer responses.</p>
<p>First, there is a</p>
<p>growing set of important research questions where ML is required.</p>
<p>Marketing in practice involves</p>
<p>important elements that impact consumers that cannot be appropriately captured by structured</p>
<p>data (e.g.</p>
<p>text,</p>
<p>visual</p>
<p>design,</p>
<p>music,</p>
<p>videos).</p>
<p>Yet,</p>
<p>the vast majority of</p>
<p>research has focused on</p>
<p>structured data,</p>
<p>since they are more available and have standardized methods to analyze them.</p>
<p>Traditional non-ML quantitative methods are not great at capturing the nuances of unstructured</p>
<p>data.</p>
<p>Moreover, ML also makes it feasible to generate novel unstructured data like text or images.</p>
<p>Given their growing capabilities, ML models are being increasingly used in academia and industry.</p>
<p>However, they are typically opaque black box models (e.g.</p>
<p>ChatGPT), leading to significant prob-</p>
<p>lems.</p>
<p>First, these models are highly complex (with billions of parameters) and humans don’t know</p>
<p>the interpretation of these parameters.</p>
<p>We also don’t know the data on which they are trained.</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>they do not have a true understanding of</p>
<p>the consumer.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>Third,</p>
<p>they are typically not</p>
<p>interpretable – we don’t know<i> why</i> they work.</p>
<p>They are prone to failure (e.g.</p>
<p>hallucinations), and</p>
<p>we cannot know<i> when</i> this will happen because we have little visibility.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>My focus is on solving these challenges, developing better ML methods based on theory or struc-</p>
<p>tured knowledge.</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>My background, being fluent with both microfounded theory-based models and</p>
<p>in ML, has enabled me to bring a unique perspective to this research.</p>
<p>My research is focused around</p>
<p>three aspects:</p>
<p>(a) developing methods to incorporate structured knowledge into ML models,</p>
<p>(b)</p>
<p>provide complete model and data transparency, and (c) improve explainability and interpretability</p>
<p>along with performance.</p>
<p>Rather than using commercially available black box models,</p>
<p>I develop</p>
<p>models from basic elements.</p>
<p>All of my ML research is transparent with the open source code pub-</p>
<p>licly available for others to examine,</p>
<p>critique and build on.</p>
<p>I believe this approach can improve</p>
<p>stakeholder trust and acceptance of AI systems.</p>
<p>The sources of knowledge that I examine include ideas and concepts from fields like marketing</p>
<p>and economics, but is not limited to these.</p>
<p>However, building in theoretical foundations within ML</p>
<p>methods is typically quite challenging.</p>
<p>The question is how to incorporate theory into complex deep</p>
<p>learning models with unstructured data.</p>
<p>Such a challenge holds even in the case of reinforcement</p>
<p>learning with structured data.</p>
<p>Below, I detail the specifics of my research in ML to illustrate the</p>
<p>approach.</p>
<p>3</p>
<p>The same CNN deep net models used for marketing applications are also used in biology.</p>
<p>4</p>
<p>Consider the algorithms for self-driving vehicles illustrating these points – only now are we beginning to get some</p>
<p>idea about the inner workings.</p>
<p>See The Hidden Autopilot Data That Reveals Why Teslas Crash (Wall Street Journal,</p>
<p>07/30/2024).</p>
<p>5</p>
<p>Other researchers are trying to integrate theory from their academic fields into ML, e.g.</p>
<p>in physics [O1].</p>

<p><i><b>2024</b></i></p>

<h1 style="page-break-before:always; "></h1>
<p><i>Visual</i></p>
<p><i>Characteristics:</i></p>
<p>I aim to quantify consumer preferences for visual characteristics in [P19].</p>
<p>Visual appearance is high-dimensional and hard to characterize and explain, without human input.</p>
<p>I develop a theory-based algorithm to automatically discover and quantify visual</p>
<p>characteristics</p>
<p>of</p>
<p>products.</p>
<p>Theory plays a crucial</p>
<p>role in the following ways.</p>
<p>First,</p>
<p>the objective function is</p>
<p>designed to incentivize low-dimensional and orthogonal representations, based on the idea that the</p>
<p>product designs satisfy that property.</p>
<p>Second is the idea that products often have a distinct look</p>
<p>tied to the brand,</p>
<p>with recognizable “visual</p>
<p>signatures” like LV handbags or BMW cars.</p>
<p>Brands</p>
<p>typically have a consistent aesthetic,</p>
<p>and consumers form expectations around this.</p>
<p>The method</p>
<p>extracts visual characteristics from product images using brand and other characteristics to super-</p>
<p>vise disentanglement.</p>
<p>The method obtains significantly better performance<i> and</i> interpretability,</p>
<p>and importantly, can<i> generate</i> counterfactual visual designs without human judgment.</p>
<p><i>Music and Emotion:</i></p>
<p>In the music emotion research [P7], the ideas about consonance and disso-</p>
<p>nance of music, and how that connects to the listener’s emotion is aided by using domain knowledge</p>
<p>(theory) from multiple fields.</p>
<p>Specifically,</p>
<p>the knowledge is based on both:</p>
<p>(a) the mathematics</p>
<p>of sound waves and (b) psychology of human music perception.</p>
<p>Explaining why a listener feels a</p>
<p>specific emotion when listening to music was a black box earlier.</p>
<p>Here, theory is used as the basis</p>
<p>for creating flexible and non-contiguous consonance filters,</p>
<p>helping obtain a representation that</p>
<p>enables explainability, so we can visualize the features of music impacting listener responses.</p>
<p>The</p>
<p>application also enables a form of contextual</p>
<p>targeting for ads,</p>
<p>without using any consumer data</p>
<p>(aiding privacy).</p>
<p><i>Learning Unknown Demand Curves:</i></p>
<p>To learn an unknown demand curve by experimentation,</p>
<p>I develop a reinforcement learning model</p>
<p>with nonparametric multi-armed bandits (MAB) [P20].</p>
<p>Economic theory informs us that demand curves are downward sloping.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>The classic experiment</p>
<p>(A/B testing) benchmark is inefficient since it explores all prices equally, whereas MABs provide a</p>
<p>more sophisticated approach (“learning while earning”).</p>
<p>However,<i> how</i> to incorporate theory here</p>
<p>is not quite obvious.</p>
<p>I find that monotonicity adds two sources of</p>
<p>value.</p>
<p>First,</p>
<p>it improves the</p>
<p>performance of the algorithm substantially since it learns not just from each individual</p>
<p>price (or</p>
<p>arm) experimented,</p>
<p>but across arms (an informational externality).</p>
<p>Second,</p>
<p>including theoretical</p>
<p>guarantees that the resulting demand curve obtained is monotonic is especially important when</p>
<p>algorithms are trusted and used to make automated pricing decisions.</p>
<p>Without monotonicity,</p>
<p>we</p>
<p>can get an upward sloping demand curve,</p>
<p>and the algorithm would choose unrealistically high</p>
<p>prices, increasing the risk of failure.</p>
<p>Overall, all the ML-based research I have undertaken brings in the power of structured knowledge</p>
<p>to enhance the capability of ML along several aspects:</p>
<p>performance, interpretability / explainability,</p>
<p>and providing representations satisfying desirable properties.</p>
<p>In turn, these ML methods are useful</p>
<p>to help us gain valuable insights into consumer and firm behavior, leading to a symbiotic process.</p>
<p>I plan to continue to explore theory-based ML methods and new business models enabled by ML.</p>
<p>6</p>
<p>There are exceptions (e.g.</p>
<p>Veblen goods).</p>

<p><b>Teaching</b></p>
<p>I have developed and taught elective courses at the masters and doctoral</p>
<p>levels,</p>
<p>and have also</p>
<p>contributed to the executive MBA and executive education.</p>
<p>I use a mix of lectures to help with</p>
<p>learning principles, complemented with discussions featuring case studies by the Socratic method.</p>
<p>In<i> Digital</i></p>
<p><i>Strategy</i>,</p>
<p>I explore digital</p>
<p>business models (e.g.</p>
<p>Dropbox),</p>
<p>and evaluate models used</p>
<p>by disruptors and complementors.</p>
<p>I investigate the drivers and barriers of platform success,</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>examine digital</p>
<p>transformation and emerging technologies.</p>
<p>Given the connection to my research,</p>
<p>I’ve incorporated exercises based on research into the course material.</p>
<p>Digital transformation has</p>
<p>been used in custom executive education programs at Yale, e.g.</p>
<p>YGELP.</p>
<p>I recently developed and taught a masters-level elective course titled<i> Artificial Intelligence:</i></p>
<p><i>Strat-</i></p>
<p><i>egy &amp; Marketing</i>.</p>
<p>The objective is to help students understand the ideas,</p>
<p>gain familiarity with</p>
<p>the methods and their business applications.</p>
<p>I introduce the primary ML methods (supervised,</p>
<p>supervised,</p>
<p>reinforcement and generative),</p>
<p>followed by an examination of</p>
<p>how organizations ob-</p>
<p>tain value from AI,</p>
<p>through case studies.</p>
<p>I also demonstrate how fairness (and bias) can be and</p>
<p>are often designed into algorithms,</p>
<p>whether intentionally or not,</p>
<p>and the resulting implications</p>
<p>for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>In my pedagogical experiments, I’ve found that assigning students to present</p>
<p>(carefully selected) academic papers can be effective, with faculty guidance.</p>
