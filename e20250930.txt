Dear Kapil,

Thanks so much for inviting me to visit SMU, and being such a wonderful host. It was a delight to meet you in person, appreciate the wonderful coffee too!

I really enjoyed the visit, including the interactive seminar (excellent questions, including some for my follow up research) and the one on one meetings. You have built a really nice and collegial group doing very interesting research, and I learned something useful from each meeting.

I think SMU is very well positioned to be on a high-growth trajectory like you mentioned. I would be very interested in contributing here, specifically the PhD program, and AI center with connection to industry / policy makers / government, and higher impact research projects. My sense is all faculty and PhD students could benefit a lot too, when structured appropriately. There seems to be great potential, and it would be helpful to discuss more.

I appreciated learning from your experience about the daily life too. Living in Singapore seems like a very familyâ€‘friendly experience, with education system, safe neighborhoods, public transport all being highlights. 

The visit served to only greatly enhance my interest in SMU and Singapore on both professional and personal aspects. I really look forward to connecting again sometime soon.

Best,
vineet

Dear Sandeep,

It was my first visit to SMU, and I really enjoyed it, thanks for making me feel so welcome, including an office next to yours. I learned a lot from our conversation, both about SMU and life in Singapore, including schooling options. More broadly, the visit was very helpful and I am keenly interested.

The faculty colleagues in Marketing are really thoughtful, and doing interesting work. The environment at the department seems clearly supportive of junior faculty and research, and I think they also appreciate the financial support as well as the lower early career teaching load. Like we talked, I have generally been interested in collaborating with and mentoring PhD students and junior faculty, and given the department's growth trajectory, there is a lot that can be done.

It was also helpful to learn about the different programs and teaching options for faculty, shows a lot of flexibility by the school and department.

Thank you too for sharing your personal journey to and at SMU, it was really good to talk about our overlapping small world too. I definitely hope to continue our conversations in the near future.

Best,
vineet

Dear Sabine,

I really enjoyed meeting your during my visit to SMU. Thank you for picking me up from the hotel and walking me to SMU, while explaining the impressive growth story of the university.

You also have a wonderful and collegial marketing group, and it was really nice to get to know the faculty and learn what they are working on.

I think it is also the first school I've heard of a unique role dedicated to social impact, which is clearly very important, and helps me understand the institution and how you think about future priorities.

Best,

Dear Melvyn,

It was great to meet you during my short visit to SMU and Singapore. It was really helpful to understand how the leadership sees the potential for SMU and business more specifically, and what strategic priorities are in focus. Your clear articulation of the vision was very encouraging.

It was also interesting to reconnect about our experiences at Harvard / Yale, and to see how institutions or programs develop unique characteristics.

Like I mentioned, I would be keenly interested in working with and mentoring PhD students and junior faculty. I think the opportunities to establish an AI-focused center to serve as a connection between academia and companies, and also other stakeholders like the government would be really attractive too.

Given all our discussions, SMU seems like a place with tremendous opportunities, and I look forward to our continued conversation.

Best,
Vineet

Dear Ernst,

Thanks for inviting me to visit SMU. I really enjoyed meeting you, and learning more about the PhD program, including the course work and their path to graduation. 

I see both a solid base, and a lot of potential for growth for research among both faculty and PhD students. It seems like the excellent access to resources, along with collaboration with industry partners are all real and distinct possibilities, making such growth feasible.

You have a wonderful group of both junior and senior faculty, and the interactive seminar and lunch were also wonderful experiences, showcasing the collegiality of the group. I certainly hope to reconnect soon.

Best,

Dear Thomas,

I really enjoyed meeting you during my visit to SMU. Thanks for sharing your experiences both at SMU and life in Singapore. 

I think your points about being in the center of this impressive growth story and having access to business and educational sectors in Asia is really important and valuable. I was also very impressed by the grants you are writing and developing, and the degree to which the school supports such activities by faculty, it's usually an afterthought at most places I know of.

I look forward to staying in touch.

Dear Michelle,

I really enjoyed meeting you during lunch, thanks for joining and for hosting me at SMU. It was great to hear about the growth and development of SMU from the early days from you, who was part of the founding or building process. It's really challenging to have that work, and I learned a lot listening to you sharing that.

Hope to connect in the near future.

Best,

I recently visited Singapore Management University for a recruiting visit including seminar talk. Things that impressed me: colleagues and collegiality in the department and school, growth and potential, located at the center of fast growing business in asia, potential to get involved and take the phd program to the next level, and help to build the group.

the associate dean of impact A picked me up from my hotel and walked me over to the campus, a nice gesture.  deputy dean B took me out for really good coffee. the department chair C took me out to dinner with colleagues. another deputy dean D for faculty explained the priorities for the future, helped me understand the school's values and trajectory.

can you draft a few e-mails to faculty colleagues thanking them for my visit? also mention some benefits of singapore from a family perspective in some emails.
