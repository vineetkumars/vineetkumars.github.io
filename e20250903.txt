Hi Olivia and Sarah,

Olivia, it was great to meet you at QME, thanks for chatting about the seminar scheduling. I think I am scheduled to visit Berkeley on December 8. Like I mentioned, I was talking with Ganesh earlier, and realized that it might be a challenging time, because it is the end of term, and people may also be traveling.

I was wondering if it might be possible to visit in Spring 2026 instead.
I'm pretty flexible in late Jan / Feb / March. I very much look forward to visiting Berkeley and meeting all of you.

Best,
Vineet

Hi Carl,

Hope all is well. It was great to meet you at QME in Chicago. Thank you for your supportive comments, I really appreciate it as I am going through my search now.

If there's a position that may open in the near future at Duke, I would of course be very interested,  both from a professional and personal view. Hope to see you at a conference in the near future.

Best,
vineet

Hi Oded,

Hope your fall term has begun well.

Thank you so much for your support and positive encouragement as I was going through some tough days earlier this spring and summer. And also for checking on the possibility regarding the Digital Futures position. I am currently going through my job search process, and I wanted to reach out to ask for your help. As you might know, NYU has an open position, and I think it would be a wonderful opportunity. I've meet the faculty each year at four-school and think it would be an excellent fit. I had received an offer from them when I was a rookie too, and have really fond memories of the faculty during my visits.

I was wondering if you might be open to suggesting or recommending me to any of the senior quant faculty there. I think your word would go a long way, and I would truly appreciate it if you are able to.

Thank you for your consideration, and hope to see you sometime in the near future.

Best Regards,
Vineet

Hi John,
Thank you for the wonderful update about your discussions at the department, I'm truly grateful for the support and interest. I too look forward to continuing our discussions in person.

I completely agree about what you suggest regarding there being normative agreement about the DVs, makes it more objective. Could also  examine this in an initial study, trying to figure out how much agreement there is (and why) on a good / bad scale for potential DVs.

Best,
vineet
