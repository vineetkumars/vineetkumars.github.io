Dear Raph,

It was really great to catch up with you at QME. I just wanted to let you how much I appreciate your kind support and offer to help. As I go through the search process, it is incredibly meaningful and timely too.

I've just started going to campus visits now, and I hope to get some sense of how the market will play out. Following our conversation on positioning, I'll share a couple of paragraphs about how I'm

Dear Kash,

It was wonderful to be able to see you and Jayanthi in your office last week. I can only imagine what you have gone through, in terms of dealing with this terrible event and situation. Meeting you was a highlight, and brought back wonderful memories of how much you care about the people and the institution, and how much you have done for everyone throughout your tenure here. I cannot ever thank you enough for your unwavering support, both professional and personal, during my years here.

HBS and the students are indeed lucky to have you. Like I said, I cannot think of anyone but you who would continue to take on teaching under these difficult circumstances. You have a wealth of knowledge and experiences to share that would not only make them better business school students, but they would also learn to be better as a person from you.

I wish you, Jayanthi and your family the best as you cope with the day to day challenges, and hope that each day is a better one, always.

Warm Regards,
Vineet
