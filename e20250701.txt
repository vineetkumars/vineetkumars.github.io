Dear Pradeep,

I hope you are doing well. Thank you for your truly generous advice and support during this challenging job search process, including at the doctoral consortium at Marketing Science. 

At this time, given the continuing uncertainty in terms of hiring at schools in the US, we are now exploring other locations as well. Iâ€™m attaching my latest CV here. 

I wanted to request your help suggesting me as you think appropriate to the following schools in the UK:
1) London Business School 
2) London School of Economics
3) Imperial
4) UCL (I think Yiting Deng is the only tenured person in marketing)
5) Cambridge (Jaideep Prabhu I think is the recruiting chair)

LBS has a rookie position, UCL and Cambridge have open rank positions and LSE and Imperial have nothing posted at this time.

I would very much appreciate your kind support as always, and with your help in keeping the process confidential.

Best regards,
Vineet

Hello Peter,

Thanks for sharing the raw data files earlier. I looked through the data, and my sense is it would be much more useful to start with the complete data and code used to create the results for the reduced form paper we submitted to JMR (Hopefully, we hear back soon from them as well). That will be the appropriate source to serve as a starting point for the structural model.

Best,
Vineet
