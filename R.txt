OB: I've been away this week on vacation but just caught up on email and the positive BPO vote. Congratulations! I'll be keeping my fingers crossed for good news from the Provost. SOM is lucky to have you!

1. Congratulations On the school vote by the BPO to move this to the final stage. It’s been a long journey and all the best for the last step.
2. (Tentative) Congrats
Hey, I’m now scared to start vicariously celebrating too early, given “recent events,” but congrats all the same!    (Big hurdle and big accomplishment.)
3. Big Congratulations!
So happy for you — absolutely deserve it and will have drinks at Asia!
Will be back next week and hope to catch up with you soon.
