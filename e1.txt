(3) Time Consistency 
In 2019-2020, I was reviewed and approved for promotion to Associate Professor and I received very positive feedback from senior faculty at SOM. During my debrief following the positive decision regarding my promotion, I met with Deputy Dean Edieal Pinker and my committee chair, K. Sudhir. Dean Pinker specifically said that my research was viewed as high quality by leading faculty in the field, and that senior faculty liked it. I then asked specifically for advice towards the next full professor promotion, and he suggested that get my working papers published, and that there was no other advice. Senior faculty echoed that view in one-on-one meetings, and the most senior faculty in my group said that “Not that there was any doubt, but congratulations on the promotion and looks good for the big one!” Over the years, I have had many official senior faculty mentors, who all echoed similar sentiments that they thought my record looked on track for tenure. Even much later, leading into my full professor tenure decision, in Spring 2024, I was told by my committee chair that “You have done everything required for tenure at Yale.”  Yale had thus reviewed my earlier work throughout the years and senior faculty have consistent viewed it very positively. No negative aspects were ever brought up.

I have received feedback from senior faculty that my recent work following the promotion has also similarly been viewed very positively and that I should be proud of my record. I have also been told my my chair that “You absolutely deserved tenure here” even after the negative tenure decision. This lack of consistency over time in the process is not reflective of a fair process.
