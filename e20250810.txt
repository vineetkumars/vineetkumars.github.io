Hi Sridhar,

Thank you for taking the time to talk with me the other day. Thank you for your kind support for my next steps, I think we'll get more clarity in the coming weeks on which options look more feasible, and will keep you updated. It was also helpful to know that Stanford is only looking for rookies currently, so I have not applied. It would be great if you could let me know in the event that your needs change.

Best,
vineet

Dear Ziv,

Thank you again for the interview on Wednesday, I really enjoyed the interaction with you and the group. I especially appreciated learning about the culture of the department, it seems like you have carefully developed a cohesive and collaborative group of both junior and senior faculty doing highly relevant research using a rigorous and thoughtful approach. 

I also heard wonderful things about the group at INSEAD from many, including my co-author David Krackhardt and Olivier Rubel, whom I've known for a long time. If there is anything else that you might think would be helpful, kindly let me know.

Best,
vineet
