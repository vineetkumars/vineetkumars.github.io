Hello Heather,

Hope the summer is going well for you. I wanted to share an update on my search, and check in to explore the school's flexibility regarding my teaching.

I would ideally be able to have clarity on my next steps in the fall, and certainly well before Spring 2, 2026, since I'm scheduled to teach very heavily in that term. However, the upcoming year on the academic job market is looking much more complex and challenging than anticipated, and looks like my search could be extended. Some have also suggested that industry options would be appropriate to consider after the academic season. In terms of location, more international options are available, which also adds more logistical complexity in preparing for the transition, both professionally and personally. 

I have also been allocated only one PhD student as TA for my 4 sections.

Given this complex and uncertain landscape, I was wondering whether the school might allow me to forego my teaching in return for reduced compensation. Senior colleagues at other schools have suggested that the practice of buying out teaching is sometimes an option in their schools. 

I thought I would be remiss if I did not check in with you on whether this could be a possible option at Yale SOM during my terminal year.

Thank you for your consideration.

Best Regards,
Vineet
