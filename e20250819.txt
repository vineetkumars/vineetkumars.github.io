Hi Dipankar, Meng, Shane and Boya,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with me. I really enjoyed our research discussion, including the philosophical as well as the technical aspects. I came away with much enthusiasm for your intellectually curiosity, and the focus on research. I'm also really glad I have gotten to know most of you very well over the years as well. I look forward to reconnecting again in the near future.

Best Regards,
Vineet

Hi Stephan,

Thanks for taking the time to talk with me. Really enjoyed our conversation, and as someone who has gone through a similar experience, I truly appreciate your perspective on both your experience, as well as practical guidance in terms of concrete steps for me.

Do let me know whenever you've had a chance to explore how your department is thinking about a senior quant hire, and a bit of the process stuff. Look forward to talking again. All the best with the newborn, and hope you enjoy the growing stages.

Best,
vineet

p.s. I do apologize, but it seems like a new Zoom feature (?) automatically sent me a meeting summary. I'm not sure if it was in my settings, but I wasn't sure either you or I would be comfortable with it, so ended up deleting it. Let me know if you have any concerns about this. I need to figure out how to configure this not be on by default.
