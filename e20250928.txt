Dear Catherine,

Thank you for your kind and patient guidance in the review process for our paper.
We have undertaken a careful evaluation of how to add supply-side decisions by content creators into the analysis, consistent with your guidance. We have done this with a view to enhancing the contribution of the paper to also speak to the creator economy. We hope and expect that the revised positioning and additional analysis would prove helpful in taking the submission forward.

We do apologize for the delay in responding, due to one of the authors being involved in a job search at this time.

Thank you, always, for your extraordinarily thoughtful and kind guidance.

Best Regards,
Vineet
