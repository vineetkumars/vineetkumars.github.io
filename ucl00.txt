Dear Bilal,

I just wanted to share that I had an excellent and highly informative visit to UCL. Thank you for inviting me, and for the warm welcome. Learning from you about the history of the school of management, and your establishment of the PhD program were very helpful. The trajectory of the department and school is nothing short of remarkable. 

You have a strong set of both junior and some mid-career faculty, and I am very impressed by your ability to attract and develop such high-quality talent. I was also gratified by the collegial interactions with everyone in the group. The seminar was very interactive, and I really enjoyed the deep-dive discussion and engagement that happened. I can readily see myself thriving at UCL, helping mentor PhD students and junior faculty.

Given the developments in programs and faculty that you highlighted, UCL has a lot to offer in terms of both growth potential, and the unique opportunity to enhance impact and visibility of the group and the wonderful work being done by the faculty in the broader marketing community.

After the visit, I am even more keenly interested in exploring this opportunity further, I think it is a really exciting time and place to be in. I hope and trust the feeling is mutual, and look forward to connecting soon.

Kind Regards,
Vineet

Dear Mimansa,

I really enjoyed meeting with you during my visit to UCL, both during the seminar interactions and our individual meeting.

Thanks for the wonderful dinner and great conversation too. It was wonderful to be able to learn about UCL, and more broadly the academic community as well as the system in the UK. I am glad you showed me how to navigate the tube, since I had to do that the next day to the airport. I have a story about that too, but will save for another day.

I do think you’re doing very interesting and relevant research, and wish you the very best with it. Please do not hesitate to reach out anytime if you think I can be helpful, now or in the future.

Warm Regards,
Vineet

Dear Harry,

I really enjoyed meeting and getting to know you during my visit to UCL. I really enjoyed the interactive discussions during the seminar, and also our one-on-one time talking about research. I wish you the best on the projects you are doing. I’d be very glad to talk about networks in case you want to bounce something off me, or just chat sometime.

Thanks too for the dinner, and sharing the insights about UCL and the academic system in the UK, and how it is different from what I have been exposed to in the US. I have to say I learned a lot on this trip. I think the department and school are on a wonderful trajectory with impressive faculty, and I fully expect that to develop in the future.

Best,
vineet
