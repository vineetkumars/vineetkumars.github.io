Hi Bernice,

Thanks again for your help with coordinating the logistics of my visit. I just wanted to make sure the following itinerary works for you. Due to my travel requirements, I have to book 2 one-way tickets into and out of Singapore.

1) Travel Itinerary
(Incoming) Boston to Singapore:
Depart Boston 			Friday, 26-09-2025
Arrive in Singapore 	at	Sunday 28-09-2025

(Outgoing) Singapore to Paris:
Depart Singapore at 10:50 am on	Tuesday, 30-09-2025

The total amount currently is USD , but I cannot book until I receive the visa, so this may change. 

Please let me know if this travel plan looks ok.

(2) Hotel: Could you please provide me the Hotel reservation details? I would need that to apply for the Singapore visa.

(2) I have included the passport and other required documents at this link:
a) Passport page copy
b) Bank Details for reimbursement

I would appreciate if you could kindly confirm that you have all the required details, and that the itinerary works from your end. I very much look forward to the visit and to meeting all of you in September.

Best,
vineet

Dear Todd,

I really appreciate your note. I think you're well positioned to make a real impactful change to the school, so I completely understand and appreciate the timeline and the sequence of steps you've laid out. I continue to be very interested, given the experience and everything I learned during the visit. I'll certainly keep you updated as to how the market evolves during my search. I look forward to connecting again in the near future.

Best wishes,
Vineet
