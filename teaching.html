<h3> Artificial Intelligence: Strategy + Marketing (MGT 853) Spring-2 2022 (second half of spring term)</h3>
Artificial Intelligence is a general-purpose technology which has the potential to transform many aspects of business and society. In business, the impact ranges from commonplace predictive improvements at one end of the spectrum to opportunities for creating entirely new markets at the other. As background, the course will briefly introduce students to Artificial Intelligence / Machine Learning methods comprising of Unsupervised, Supervised and Reinforcement Learning. Through a combination of lectures and case studies, we will evaluate how to integrate AI into decision making, and examine the strategic choices facing companies developing developing and using AI / ML technologies. We will evaluate how both consumers and decision-makers evaluate decisions made by AI systems, and the feasibility of explainable AI. The course will also examine issues at the intersection of AI and Society including fairness and bias that are proving to be especially challenging, and an understanding of how both consumers and decision-makers evaluate decisions made by AI systems.

<h3> Digital Strategy (MGT 857) Fall-1 2021</h3>
This is an elective class designed for graduate students at the Yale School of Management.
If you are a Yale student * not * affiliated with SOM (Yale undergraduates and Masters students), you should apply directly to the professor, not through the bidding process.
You should also send an e-mail with a 1-paragraph description of your interest, Resume and Course List / Grades by e-mail: <a href="mailto:vineet.kumar@yale.edu">vineet.kumar@yale.edu</a>.
A select few will be admitted at the discretion of the instructor.

<h4>Course Objectives</h4>
The course is designed to provide a strategic perspective on digital technologies, but given the broad scope of the topic, aiming for comprehensive coverage will not be feasible. So we'll have to make tradeoffs in selecting areas to examine in depth. My goal is that a student who completes the course successfully should be able to:
<ul>
<li> Understand growth and monetization tradeoffs in adopting business models </li>
<li> Determine whether a disruptor or complementor strategy is more appropriate </li>
<li> Evaluate design and governance decisions for platforms </li>
<li> Understand challenges and opportunities involved in undertaking a digital transformation </li>
<li> Develop a perspective about new emerging technologies that could potentially reshape markets and have important strategic consequences for firms </li>
</ul>

<h4>Course Description</h4>
Digital Strategy is a short half-semester course that builds upon topics in strategy, marketing and economics to understand issues in high-tech markets. Through a mix of case studies and lectures, the course brings together a variety of issues unique to markets significantly impacted by technologies. The course is divided into 4 modules. Each module will feature a lecture session laying out the conceptual foundations followed by 2-3 case studies.

First, we begin by studying the essential elements of <B> business models</B>, and examine why we observe a variety of business models in the market, and identify opportunities and challenges in adopting these models. Second, we focus on understanding strategies that can be used by  <B> disruptors and complementors </B> , with a view to evaluating how each of these could be successful in the marketplace. Third, we focus on platforms to understand the primary issues in developing  <B> multi-sided platforms </B>  as well as the perspective of participants on platforms. Fourth, we examine  <B> technology-driven transformation</B>  both from a technology perspective (with blockchain), as well as from a firm perspective (with The New York Times).

Textbook(s): None required.
