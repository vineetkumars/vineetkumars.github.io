Hello Mili,

Thank you for the wonderful visit to SMU. I really enjoyed meeting for dinner and great conversation on Wednesday. Thanks a lot for sharing what life looks like in Dallas, both personally, and at the university too. It's great to know that you are working on related topics, but coming with a very different perspective. My sense is there are many complementarities.

The interactive seminar also highlighted the research culture, and helped me understand and appreciate the different aspects of research that people were coming from. I will be reflecting on these issues, and think there are several aspects of the research that would be great to develop further.

Hope you have a nice weekend, and look forward to meeting again sometime.

Best,
Vineet
