Hi Venky,

Thank you very much for inviting me to SMU. I'm glad we got a chance to talk on the phone before I left. I really enjoyed the campus visit, and think you have a impressive research culture, with people so interested in coming to a seminar in the summer. The quality of engagement was very special and impressive, there are many questions and suggestions including yours that I think can spark and lead to follow up research. The location was also amazing, Ed drove me around to give me a sense of the place.

As I reflect on the visit, I think SMU would provide a great platform and excellent collaborators to help me advance and expand my research agenda. I remain keenly interested in the possibility as the school figures out the steps in the  decision process. Please do keep me updated, and if there is anything I can share that might help, of course I would be very glad to.

Best,
vineet

Dear Todd,

It was really wonderful to visit SMU and reconnect with you, after meeting you at WashU earlier. The school is in such great hands, and I am truly excited for the next phase of growth under your leadership, and similarly for the university under Jay's leadership. I have to say I find it remarkable and inspiring how you continue with research despite your dean responsibilities. 

Thank you for sharing your carefully thought out and ambitious growth plans for the school's future. I fully expect the next few years will lead to wonderful developments that further establish and enhance the Cox school's profile, with Cal and Stanford now fellow schools!

I really enjoyed the visit and was really impressed by the quality of engagement during the seminar and in one on one meetings with the faculty both in Marketing and ITOM. I will stay in contact with Ed and Venky and look forward to connecting again.

All my very best, and hope you have a wonderful (rest of) summer.

Best Regards,
Vineet
