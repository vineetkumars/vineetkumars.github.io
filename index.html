<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<body>
<nav>
I am a faculty member at Yale School of Management, with interests in Technology and Business, especially in digital business models. Products based on digital technologies are ubiquitous across a wide range of industries, from financial services to healthcare to media. I aim to develop a careful understanding of how consumers make choices on purchase and consumption, and how firms can design, develop and market these products (the overall business model). Methodologically, I develop models from microfoundations of consumer and firm behavior that are informed by theory and domain knowledge. I am also interesting in theory-based machine learning, where we incorporate human domain knowledge (theory) into ML algorithms, to improve their performance, human interpretability and other desirable properties.
