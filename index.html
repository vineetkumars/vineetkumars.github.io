<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<body>
<nav>
I am a faculty member at Yale School of Management, with expertise in Digital Technologies. 

My  interests are in studying the marketing of technology markets, especially for digital products and services. Products based on Digital Technology are becoming ever more ubiquitous in a wide range of industries, ranging from healthcare to entertainment to productivity applications.
I am to develop a careful understanding of how firms can design, develop and take to market products that have potential for transforming people’s lives.
Competency in an understanding of technology is important, of course, but more crucially, complementing this knowledge with a deep understanding of customer value and designing strategies based on such research has potential to create enhanced value for both firms and consumers.
Technology and Digital Markets present a set of important and new issues. My research in this area spans the following aspects:
<ol type="A">
<li> Consumer Choices in Technology Markets
<li> Direct and Indirect Network effects
<li> Technology Transformation
<li> Big Data (especially high frequency microdata)
</ol>
<p>
Methodologically, I am an empirical modeler aiming to develop models from microfoundations of consumer and firm behavior that are informed by theory as well as practice.
