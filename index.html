<h3>Research Interests</h3>
<body>
<nav>
I am a faculty member at Yale School of Management, with interests in Technology and Business. In my research, I focus on digital business models. 
Products based on digital technologies are ubiquitous across a wide range of industries, from financial services to healthcare to media. 
I aim to develop a careful understanding of how consumers make choices on purchase and consumption, and how firms can design, develop and market these products.

<BR>
	<P>
Methodologically, I develop models from microfoundations of consumer and firm behavior that are informed by theory and domain knowledge. 
I also develop theory-based machine learning for business applications, incorporating human domain knowledge (theory) into ML algorithms, to improve their performance and human interpretability.
